Classifying types of clothing is useful for clothing retailers, especially retailers with a digital presence who sell clothing online. Being able to automatically categorize items of clothing is useful for creating search options on an online platform for consumers to narrow down product searches. We develop a clothing classification model using logistic regression and k-nearest neighbor techniques. We conclude that using the k-nearest neighbors model with more advanced feature selection methods is the most accurate way to classify clothing labels without the use of neural networks.
