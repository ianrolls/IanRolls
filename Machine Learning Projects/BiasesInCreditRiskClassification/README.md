# BIASES IN CREDIT RISK CLASSIFICATION

<h4> This folder contains a lot of different files and therefore needs some more navigation tips.

Like the other folders, it contains a PDF LaTeX write-up that explains every step of the project - this is the easiest to digest although it is a long paper.

Some important context is that my partner and I split the project into two different datasets, there was an older dataset from Germany that my partner analyzed, and a new dataset (completely up-to-date) - the Bondora dataset - that I analysed. Therefore, if you want to get a good idea of my work for this project, the only file you need to look at is the "BondoraModel.ipynb" file. The corresponding dataset is the "LoneReshaped_E.csv" file. 

The "LoanDataReshaping.ipynb" file was my data processing file which took the original Bondora dataset ("LoanReshaped.csv") and pruned empty rows and extracted the relevant features.

The rest of the files are my partner's work. Anything that has the word "German" in the file name is her work, although I dont exactly know how she organized all of her files. I wanted to include all if her files just in case it was of interest. </h4>
