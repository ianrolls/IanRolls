Beyond the scope of clothing classification, computer vision classification is incredibly important. It is a forefront of machine learning because it is one of the areas where humans can still outperform some models. In the most complex computer vision models, lots of feature engineering is done to capture parts of the image that humans might subconsciously understand in order to improve model accuracy, like in the Zhou et al. model.

An example of a computer vision classification problem might be classifying bird types from snapshots of natural photos, or counting the number of unique people in a photo (classifying a person as unique or seen). This could be helpful for a birding application, or automatically tracking the number of people who attend an event.

Beyond the general scope, this specific classification problem could be expanded beyond clothing to goods in general. Any type of store that needs to do some sort of inventory count (IKEA or Target or a grocery store, for example) would find an item classification problem incredibly useful to save manual classification labor. I imagine that our model would be even more useful given more distinct categories, or even classifying brand items that have more distinct colors and patterns.
