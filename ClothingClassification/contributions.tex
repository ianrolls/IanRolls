I.R. formatted the datasets and added any extra variables. C.H. made all of the graphics and tables. Both I.R. and C.H. worked on the implementation of sklearn solvers. C.H. wrote the Abstract, Introduction, Exploratory Analysis, Results, and Bibliography sections. Ian wrote the Dataset, Experiments, Broader Impacts, and Conclusion sections. Both I.R. and C.H. proofread all sections.
