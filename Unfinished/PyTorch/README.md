# UNFINISHED WORK

<h4> This folder contains all unfinished work and current project work. NOTE: it also contains some files that are not my own but are being used as learning resources, so if you are an employer/recruiter looking at this, it wont be helpful because I dont add labels for which files are my own work. </h4>
